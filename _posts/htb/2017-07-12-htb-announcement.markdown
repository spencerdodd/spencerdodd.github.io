My posting here has been a little less frequent lately. One reason is that I am currently taking a graduate course in secure software development that takes up a fair amount of my time. Another is that I try to do some things away from my computer screen (or at least away from a terminal) from time to time. The final reason is that I am currently working through the machines hosted on [hackthebox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). Unfortunately, it is against site rules to post solutions to, or writeups about, the boxes so I am unable to update my progress here. I have been doing writeups, but for my eyes only ;)

I will continue to post about challenges that I do that are unrelated to the hackthebox challenges in addition to notes, tips, tricks, and scripts that I collect along the way. I might start to post some things related to my job as well, which would include some progress on creating bioinformatics pipelines for high throughput sequencing datasets. That would be both to keep some content flowing on here as well as to keep some notes about my work accessible in a more public way.

If you want to track my progress on htb, you can check out my profile link [here](https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/3470)
